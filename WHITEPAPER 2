Abstract

Despite the success of combination antiretroviral therapy (ART), HIV persists as a global public health challenge due to the formation of latent viral reservoirs that evade immune clearance and enable viral rebound upon treatment interruption. Current cure strategies remain limited by insufficient reservoir detection sensitivity, incomplete immune reconstitution, and the inability to personalize interventions across heterogeneous patient populations.

We present the CORONA Protocol, a quantum-inspired, AI-orchestrated systems framework for HIV cure research that integrates ultra-sensitive reservoir detection, spatial tissue cartography, multi-scale systems biology modeling, and adaptive therapeutic orchestration. Rather than proposing a single curative intervention, the protocol defines a modular platform capable of coordinating detection, immune modulation, gene-based strategies, and preventive immunity within a patient-specific digital twin.

The CORONA Protocol reframes HIV cure as a coordinated intelligence problem, enabling progressive increases in durable remission and cure probability while maintaining rigorous safety, ethical governance, and global scalability. This framework establishes a unifying architecture for evaluating, combining, and optimizing emerging HIV cure strategies under real-world constraints.

1. Introduction

1.1 Background

HIV infection remains incurable despite decades of biomedical progress. ART effectively suppresses viral replication and restores immune function but fails to eliminate proviral DNA integrated into long-lived host cells. These latent reservoirs persist in multiple anatomical compartments, including gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), lymph nodes, bone marrow, and central nervous system microglia.

Upon ART interruption, viral rebound typically occurs within weeks, underscoring the central challenge of HIV cure: the detection, characterization, and elimination or permanent silencing of viral reservoirs.

1.2 Limitations of Current Cure Efforts

Existing cure strategies face key limitations:
   •   Insufficient sensitivity to detect rare reservoir cells
   •   Limited spatial resolution of reservoir distribution
   •   Incomplete immune reconstitution and T-cell exhaustion
   •   High inter-patient heterogeneity in viral and host factors
   •   Lack of adaptive trial frameworks integrating mechanistic feedback

These constraints suggest that HIV cure is not a single therapeutic problem, but a systems-level challenge requiring coordinated intelligence across biology, computation, and clinical governance.

2. Conceptual Framework

2.1 Central Hypothesis

We hypothesize that HIV cure probability increases when interventions are:
	1.	guided by ultra-sensitive, spatially resolved reservoir measurement,
	2.	personalized using mechanistic digital twin models, and
	3.	adaptively orchestrated through AI-driven decision systems.

2.2 Platform-Based Cure Architecture

The CORONA Protocol is designed as a modular research platform, not a fixed treatment. It integrates four layers:
	1.	Detection and Measurement Layer
	2.	Spatial Reservoir Cartography Layer
	3.	Systems Biology Digital Twin Layer
	4.	Cure Orchestration and Adaptive Trial Layer

Each layer can operate independently or in combination, enabling incremental validation and deployment.

3. Ultra-Sensitive Reservoir Detection

3.1 Single-Cell and Molecular Detection

The protocol proposes multiplexed detection of HIV DNA, RNA, host-virus junctions, and epigenetic marks at the single-cell level. These measurements enable probabilistic classification of infected cells according to:
   •   proviral presence,
   •   transcriptional activity,
   •   epigenetic repression, and
   •   immune visibility.

Reservoir burden is modeled as a probabilistic sum across cells rather than a binary infected/uninfected classification.

3.2 Viral Diversity and Evolution Analysis

High-throughput viral genome sampling enables:
   •   quasispecies diversity estimation,
   •   recombination rate tracking,
   •   immune escape mutation surveillance, and
   •   patient-specific therapy targeting.

These data inform both therapeutic design and immune intervention strategies.

⸻

4. Spatial Reservoir Cartography

4.1 Whole-Body Reservoir Mapping

The protocol emphasizes spatial localization of reservoirs across anatomical compartments, recognizing that immune access and therapeutic penetration vary by tissue. Longitudinal mapping supports:
   •   identification of sanctuary sites,
   •   monitoring of therapeutic penetration, and
   •   detection of spatial relapse patterns.

4.2 Lymphoid Microenvironment Analysis

Detailed characterization of lymph node architecture enables analysis of:
   •   follicular immune exclusion,
   •   checkpoint ligand density,
   •   infected-cell network topology, and
   •   immune synapse formation dynamics.

These insights guide strategies to improve immune access to protected reservoirs.

5. Immune Exhaustion and Reconstitution Modeling

5.1 High-Dimensional Immune Profiling

Multi-omics immune profiling quantifies exhaustion, activation, memory differentiation, metabolic state, and functional capacity of HIV-specific T cells and B cells.

5.2 Exhaustion Trajectory Modeling

Immune states are modeled along continuous trajectories:
naïve → activated → effector → exhausted → senescent,
enabling identification of intervention windows for immune checkpoint modulation and metabolic restoration.

⸻

6. Systems Biology Digital Twin

6.1 Multi-Scale Integration

The digital twin integrates:
   •   molecular host-pathogen interactions,
   •   cellular infection and latency dynamics,
   •   tissue-specific microenvironments, and
   •   whole-body viral and drug kinetics.

6.2 Latency and Reservoir Dynamics

Latency establishment and maintenance are modeled as stochastic processes influenced by:
   •   integration probability,
   •   epigenetic silencing,
   •   clonal expansion, and
   •   immune-mediated clearance.

The digital twin enables simulation of long-term outcomes under candidate interventions prior to clinical deployment.

7. Therapeutic Strategy Modules

7.1 Shock-and-Kill

Latency reversal is combined with enhanced immune-mediated clearance using antibodies, bispecific engagers, or engineered immune cells. Toxicity and cytokine thresholds are explicitly constrained.

7.2 Block-and-Lock

Transcriptional and epigenetic silencing strategies aim to induce durable remission by preventing viral reactivation, even in the presence of proviral DNA.

7.3 Gene-Based Interventions

Selective gene editing approaches target proviral excision or irreversible inactivation, subject to rigorous off-target risk assessment and long-term surveillance.

7.4 Preventive and Sterilizing Immunity

Vaccine strategies focus on broad immune coverage and mucosal protection, framed as a long-term population-level objective rather than an immediate guarantee.

⸻

8. AI-Driven Cure Orchestration

8.1 Personalized Regimen Selection

Patient-specific features (viral genotype, host genetics, immune competence, reservoir topology) are integrated to estimate cure probabilities across strategy classes.

8.2 Adaptive Platform Trials

Multi-arm, multi-stage adaptive trials enable:
   •   simultaneous evaluation of multiple strategies,
   •   real-time learning from outcomes, and
   •   ethical allocation toward more effective arms.

⸻

9. Manufacturing and Global Access

The protocol explicitly incorporates:
   •   scalable cell-therapy manufacturing,
   •   continuous-flow small-molecule synthesis,
   •   affordable diagnostics, and
   •   tiered pricing frameworks to ensure equity.

⸻

10. Ethics, Safety, and Governance

Ethical safeguards include:
   •   transparent allocation criteria,
   •   informed consent for high-risk interventions,
   •   strict ART interruption monitoring,
   •   long-term registries for cured individuals, and
   •   independent oversight bodies.

⸻

11. Limitations and Uncertainty

This framework includes both:
   •   near-term feasible components (modeling, detection, adaptive trials), and
   •   frontier components requiring long-term validation (sterilizing immunity, advanced gene therapies).

The modular design allows progressive validation without over-commitment to unproven elements.

⸻

12. Conclusion

The CORONA Protocol proposes a systems-oriented, intelligence-driven framework for HIV cure research. By integrating detection, modeling, immune engineering, and adaptive governance, it enables a coordinated path toward durable remission and eventual eradication.

Rather than promising an immediate cure, this platform establishes the infrastructure through which HIV cure becomes progressively achievable, scalable, and equitable.
