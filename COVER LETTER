Dear Editor,

We are pleased to submit the manuscript entitled “A Systems-Oriented Framework for HIV Cure: Integrating Ultra-Sensitive Reservoir Detection, Digital Twin Modeling, and Adaptive Therapeutic Orchestration” for consideration as a Perspective / Review Article in Nature Medicine.

Despite the transformative impact of antiretroviral therapy, HIV cure research remains constrained by persistent viral reservoirs, incomplete immune reconstitution, and substantial inter-patient heterogeneity. Current efforts often focus on individual therapeutic modalities in isolation. In this manuscript, we propose a systems-oriented framework that integrates ultra-sensitive reservoir measurement, spatial tissue cartography, multi-scale systems biology digital twins, and adaptive therapeutic orchestration into a unified research architecture.

Rather than advancing a specific curative intervention, this work introduces a conceptual and computational platform designed to coordinate, personalize, and ethically govern emerging HIV cure strategies. The framework emphasizes adaptive learning, patient-specific modeling, and modular integration of latency reversal, immune modulation, gene-based approaches, and preventive immunity. We believe this approach addresses a critical gap in the field by reframing HIV cure as a coordinated intelligence problem, rather than a single therapeutic challenge.

This manuscript will be of broad interest to Nature Medicine readers, including investigators in HIV cure research, systems biology, immunology, digital medicine, and global health. It offers a unifying structure capable of accelerating translational insight while maintaining rigorous safety, ethical oversight, and global scalability.

The manuscript is original, has not been published elsewhere, and is not under consideration by another journal. The author declares no competing interests. All ethical considerations relevant to the conceptual framework are discussed within the manuscript.

Thank you for your time and consideration. We appreciate the opportunity to submit our work to Nature Medicine and look forward to your response.

Sincerely,
