Executive Summary

HIV remains a global health challenge due primarily to the persistence of latent viral reservoirs that evade immune clearance and rebound after antiretroviral therapy (ART) interruption. Despite transformative ART efficacy, a scalable, safe, and durable cure requires:
	1.	precise detection of residual infection,
	2.	reservoir elimination or stable silencing,
	3.	immune restoration, and
	4.	manufacturable global access.

The CORONA Protocol for HIV Cure proposes a platform-based cure-orchestration system integrating:
   •   Ultra-sensitive reservoir measurement (single-cell + tissue-scale mapping),
   •   Systems biology digital twins (patient-specific mechanistic modeling),
   •   AI-driven regimen selection (adaptive decision intelligence), and
   •   Multi-modal cure strategies (shock-and-kill, block-and-lock, gene/immune therapies, and vaccine-induced protection).

The central thesis is that HIV cure is not a single intervention, but a coordinated intelligence problem: cure outcomes improve when detection, therapy design, immune modulation, and monitoring are orchestrated as an adaptive system.

1. Problem Statement

1.1 Why HIV Is Hard to Cure

HIV establishes infection in long-lived cells, integrating proviral DNA into host genomes and forming reservoirs across diverse anatomical compartments. These reservoirs:
   •   are rare (often below standard detection thresholds),
   •   may be anatomically protected (e.g., lymphoid follicles, CNS microglia), and
   •   can persist for years under ART via clonal expansion and low-level reactivation.

1.2 Cure Definitions

This platform targets two cure endpoints:
   •   Sterilizing Cure: No replication-competent virus remains; rebound is impossible.
   •   Durable Remission / Functional Cure: Virus is controlled without ART long-term due to immune surveillance and/or stable proviral silencing.

2. Core Architecture Overview

The CORONA Protocol is designed as a modular platform with four interlocking layers:
	1.	Detection & Measurement Layer
Ultra-sensitive assays to quantify reservoirs and active replication at single-cell and tissue levels.
	2.	Spatial Reservoir Cartography Layer
3D/4D mapping of reservoir topology and immune access constraints across organs.
	3.	Systems Biology & Digital Twin Layer
Multi-scale patient-specific modeling linking molecular interactions to whole-body dynamics.
	4.	Cure Orchestration Layer
AI-driven selection and optimization of cure regimens, monitoring, and adaptive trial execution.

3. Ultra-Sensitive Directional Detection

3.1 Single-Cell Reservoir Mapping

The platform proposes multiplexed detection of:
   •   HIV DNA regions (LTR, gag, pol, env, nef),
   •   host-virus junctions (integration features),
   •   epigenetic suppression marks at provirus, and
   •   transcriptional activity markers (tat/rev; spliced/unspliced RNA).

Goal: characterize for each candidate reservoir cell:
   •   infection status,
   •   proviral intactness likelihood,
   •   transcriptional state,
   •   immune visibility and killability.

A probabilistic reservoir model estimates latent probability and viral copy number per cell:
   •   Reservoir size = Σ_cells P(latent|cell) × VCN(cell)

3.2 Single-Virion Sequencing and Diversity Metrics

High-throughput viral genome sampling supports:
   •   quasispecies diversity estimation,
   •   recombination tracking,
   •   immune escape mutation surveillance, and
   •   personalized immunogen/therapy targeting.

Key outputs: diversity indices, pairwise distance, escape mutation frequencies, recombination rate estimates.

4. 4D Spatial Reservoir Cartography

4.1 Whole-Body Imaging for Reservoir Hotspot Tracking

The platform proposes periodic imaging and tissue-aware reservoir inference to track:
   •   tissue compartment burden,
   •   therapy penetration, and
   •   spatial immune exclusion.

Example reservoir distribution priors include:
   •   gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT),
   •   lymph nodes,
   •   bone marrow,
   •   CNS microglia,
   •   genital tract.

4.2 Lymph Node Microenvironment Reconstruction

High-dimensional tissue profiling identifies:
   •   immune cell trafficking patterns,
   •   follicular sanctuary features (CTL exclusion),
   •   checkpoint ligand density (e.g., PD-L1), and
   •   infected-cell network centrality.

Goal: redesign interventions to improve immune access and clearance in sanctuary niches.

5. Immune Exhaustion and Reconstitution Profiling

The platform integrates multi-omics immune profiling to quantify:
   •   exhaustion markers (PD-1, TIM-3, LAG-3, TIGIT, CTLA-4),
   •   activation, memory differentiation, and metabolic constraints,
   •   functional capacity (cytokines, killing, proliferation), and
   •   HIV-specific recognition (epitope tetramers).

A trajectory model maps immune states:
Naïve → Activated → Effector → Exhausted → Senescent
and identifies intervention windows for checkpoint modulation and metabolic repair.

6. Systems Biology Digital Twin

6.1 Multi-Scale Model

The HIV digital twin integrates:
   •   molecular host-pathogen interactions,
   •   cell infection kinetics and latency dynamics,
   •   tissue microenvironments (gut, nodes, CNS),
   •   drug distribution and viral migration.

A mechanistic core uses ODE/agent-based models linking:
   •   target CD4+ cells, infected cells, virus particles, and effectors.

6.2 Latency Establishment and Reservoir Dynamics

Reservoir persistence is modeled through:
   •   integration probability,
   •   epigenetic silencing and reactivation rates,
   •   cell division and clonal expansion,
   •   death/turnover under ART.

Outcome: patient-specific predictions for reservoir decay or persistence under candidate interventions.

7. Cure Strategy Modules

7.1 Shock-and-Kill (Precision Reactivation + Clearance)

Objective: reactivate latent cells (shock) while maximizing killing (kill) without global immune hyperactivation.

Components:
   •   Latency reversal screening and personalized combination selection
   •   Clearance enhancers: BiTEs, CAR-T, bNAbs
   •   Exhaustion reversal: checkpoint inhibitors + immune growth factors
   •   Toxicity constraints and cytokine safety limits

7.2 Block-and-Lock (Deep Silencing / Durable Remission)

Objective: prevent rebound by locking provirus into transcriptionally inert states.

Components:
   •   Tat-axis inhibition (transcription suppression)
   •   Epigenetic silencing enforcement (dCas9-KRAB/DNMT/HDAC strategies)
   •   RNA-level suppression (Cas13-like modalities)
   •   Off-target risk minimization and safety gating

7.3 Provirus Excision (Selective Gene Editing Approaches)

Objective: physically remove or irreversibly disable provirus.

Key design requirements:
   •   high-fidelity targeting,
   •   off-target risk quantification,
   •   controlled delivery,
   •   long-term monitoring for genotoxicity.

7.4 Sterilizing Immunity / Prevention-Grade Protection

Objective: reduce reinfection and suppress residual viral re-emergence through broad immune coverage.

Components:
   •   multi-Env nanoparticle immunogens,
   •   germline-targeting prime-boost schedules,
   •   mucosal delivery for IgA and resident memory T cells.

Note: this is the highest-uncertainty frontier and is presented as a long-range objective requiring extensive validation.

8. AI Orchestration and Adaptive Trials

8.1 Personalized Regimen Selection

Inputs include viral subtype/tropism, resistance patterns, HLA, CCR5 genotype, reservoir size/distribution, and immune competence metrics.

Output:
   •   per-patient probability estimates across candidate strategy classes,
   •   recommended phased protocols,
   •   monitoring intensity and safety stop rules.

8.2 Adaptive Platform Trial Design

A multi-arm, multi-stage platform trial enables:
   •   simultaneous strategy testing,
   •   adaptive allocation toward superior arms,
   •   embedded biomarker learning loops.

Primary endpoint example:
   •   sustained remission during carefully governed analytical treatment interruption (ATI), with rapid ART rescue thresholds.

9. Manufacturing and Access Strategy

9.1 Manufacturing at Scale

The platform explicitly incorporates:
   •   automated closed-system cell therapy manufacturing,
   •   off-the-shelf strategies where feasible,
   •   continuous-flow small molecule synthesis,
   •   high-throughput diagnostics with affordability targets.

9.2 Global Access and Tiered Pricing

A proposed global funding mechanism and tiered pricing system aims to ensure equitable access and reduce long-term economic burden.

10. Safety, Ethics, and Governance

Key governance commitments:
   •   transparent allocation ethics,
   •   informed consent and privacy safeguards,
   •   long-term registries for post-intervention surveillance,
   •   rigorous adverse event attribution (especially with combination stacks),
   •   strict independent ethics oversight for any ATI protocol.

⸻

11. Limitations and Scientific Uncertainty

This proposal contains both:
   •   near-term feasible components (digital twin modeling, adaptive trial simulation, reservoir measurement improvement), and
   •   frontier components (broad sterilizing immunity, highly speculative computation/throughput claims).

The platform is intentionally modular so that:
   •   near-term modules deliver value immediately,
   •   frontier modules can mature through validation without compromising credibility.

12. Roadmap

Phase 1 (R&D Enablement): Detection + digital twin + decision intelligence + trial simulation
Phase 2 (Translational Validation): tissue-informed monitoring, regimen optimization, limited intervention trials
Phase 3 (Scale Cure Trials): platform trial expansion, manufacturing scale-up
Phase 4 (Elimination Program): broad deployment + prevention-grade immunity strategies + surveillance

Conclusion

The CORONA Protocol for HIV Cure proposes a platform architecture that treats HIV cure as a coordinated systems problem spanning detection, immunology, therapy design, monitoring, ethics, and manufacturing.

The objective is not to claim an immediate cure, but to define an orchestrated intelligence framework capable of progressively increasing durable remission rates, reducing reservoirs, minimizing risk, and enabling equitable global scale.

End state vision: HIV transitions from lifelong chronic infection to a curable and preventable condition through measurable, adaptive, safe, and accessible interventions.
